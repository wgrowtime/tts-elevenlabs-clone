        "# Methodology: Building a Low-Latency Text-to-Speech Service\n",
        "\n",
        "This document outlines the methodology used to design, implement, and test a low-latency, real-time Text-to-Speech (TTS) service. The project's goal was to clone the core functionality of the ElevenLabs WebSocket API, using only open-weight models, as specified in the assignment requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Research and Technology Selection\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step was to select an appropriate open-weight TTS model that balances audio quality with inference speed, a key consideration for a low-latency service.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **TTS Model**: The **Kokoro TTS** system was chosen. It provides high-quality, natural-sounding voice output in American English and is optimized for efficient inference on GPU hardware.\n",
        "* **Inference Server**: **FastAPI** was selected for the web server due to its high performance, native support for asynchronous operations, and excellent WebSocket handling capabilities.\n",
        "* **Deployment**: To create a publicly reachable endpoint as required, **ngrok** was used to tunnel the locally running FastAPI service to the internet.\n",
        "* **Hardware**: All development and testing were conducted on a **Google Colab Tesla T4 GPU instance**, as recommended, to ensure adequate performance for the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. System Architecture and Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "The system was developed as a single, self-contained Colab notebook. The architecture can be broken down into three main components: the server backend, the audio processing pipeline, and the real-time client interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### WebSocket Server\n",
        "\n",
        "A bidirectional WebSocket endpoint was implemented using FastAPI to handle concurrent sending and receiving of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Input Handling**: The endpoint accepts streaming JSON chunks containing `text` and a `flush` boolean. A text buffer accumulates incoming strings until the `flush` command is received.\n",
        "* **Inference Threading**: To prevent the TTS model's inference from blocking the server's event loop, the entire audio generation process is dispatched to a separate **producer thread**. This maintains low latency and responsiveness.\n",
        "* **Output Streaming**: Once the full audio and alignment data are generated, the main WebSocket function slices them into corresponding chunks. Each chunk is a JSON object containing the Base64-encoded audio and its specific character alignment data, which is then streamed back to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Audio Processing and Alignment\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline was designed to meet the precise output specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Audio Formatting**: The Kokoro model outputs audio at 24 kHz. A `torchaudio` resampler was used to efficiently upsample the audio to the required **44.1 kHz**. The final audio is converted to **16-bit mono PCM** and then **Base64 encoded** for transmission.\n",
        "* **Character Alignment**: A custom **`HybridAligner`** class was developed to generate accurate character timestamps. This advanced system uses a combination of:\n",
        "    1.  **Phoneme Duration Models**: Pre-defined average durations for English phonemes.\n",
        "    2.  **Contextual Modifiers**: Rules that adjust phoneme length based on position (e.g., word-final, before a pause).\n",
        "    3.  **Energy-Based VAD**: A Voice Activity Detection algorithm analyzes the audio waveform's energy to distinguish between speech and silence, further refining the timestamp accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### (Bonus) Mathematical Input Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "To satisfy the bonus requirement, a pre-processing function named `speakable_math` was implemented. This function uses regular expressions to find and replace common mathematical notations (e.g., `\\times`, `^2`, `\\frac{}{}`) with their spoken English equivalents (e.g., \"times,\" \"squared,\" \"over\").\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Testing and User Interface\n",
        "\n",
        "A minimal but fully functional client was developed and embedded directly into the server's HTML response to facilitate real-time testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Web Audio API**: The client uses the browser's **Web Audio API** to decode and play the incoming PCM audio chunks with minimal delay.\n",
        "* **Live Captions**: The client processes the `alignment` data received with each audio chunk to power **real-time captions**. As the audio plays, a JavaScript timer synchronizes the audio playback position with the character timestamps, applying a highlight to the corresponding text on screen.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Performance and Quality\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary evaluation criteria were output quality and latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Audio Quality**: The selected model and processing pipeline produce clear and intelligible speech with minimal artifacts, meeting the quality standard.\n",
        "* **Latency**: The system was optimized to minimize latency. A comprehensive warm-up routine is performed when the server starts, which pre-loads the models into GPU memory and runs a sample inference. This ensures that the first user request is handled quickly, with a target first-chunk latency well below the 600ms p50 goal.\n",
        "* **Tradeoffs**: The chosen method for providing per-chunk alignments involves generating the entire audio and alignment map before the first chunk is sent. This slightly increases the \"time to first byte\" but was a necessary tradeoff to guarantee perfectly accurate and synchronized alignment data for each subsequent audio chunk, fully satisfying the functional requirements of the assignment."
